# PlasticFlowers
An ongoing project to create a bowl of light up plastic flowers in an upcycled industrial-style light fitting.

The petals are hand cut from plastic milk cartons, softened in a heat press and hand shaped into a 3d form. They then have a hole punched at one end using a hole punch. The stems are laser cut from 3mm ply (they're quite fragile and I might reconsider their form if doing this again). The petals are pushed on to the stems via the base (they need to stay flexible to do this - they become more brittle the more you heat them). Each flower has 8 petals, with an 8 pixel WS2812 ring sandwiched in between the top 5 and bottom 3 petals. I used a bradawl to make holes in the bottom petals to thread the leads through.

There is a grid inside the light fitting to hold the flowers. I designed this using OnShape (document here: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/9c0d1b2b6051d846cf896ee0/w/6c6e65dcf6589f03a000dfb8/e/dc36b66088d32592358b8490)

dxfs for all the laser cut files are here: https://github.com/JackiePease/PlasticFlowers/tree/main/laser-cutting-files

The lights will be run from a MCQN Ltd ["My Babys Got LED" board] (https://github.com/mcqn/my-babys-got-led) using a 30A PC power supply
